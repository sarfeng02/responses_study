Moreover, the global abject poverty rate has flipped on its head from 90% of the globe being impoverished to now only ~10% of the world living in poverty. \n\nEvery statement you have made is a malinformed opinion that is sold to you by folks in office that use it as a strategy to further increase taxes. If we were to all of a sudden stop producing hydrocarbons for everyday use (fertilizer, cleaning products, plastics, paint, clothes, concrete, medicine, transportation, energy, etc.), the world would suffer far more than it would with a <1 degree temperature rise. \n\nEvery company is greedy. This is the world we live in.",

For many, the decision to have an abortion is not taken lightly and involves significant emotional and ethical considerations.\n\nThe argument that Democrats don’t care about unborn lives is a broad generalization.

They may also be concerned about the consequences of forcing someone to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term, which could lead to significant social, economic, and psychological challenges for both the parent and child.\n\nFurthermore, the issue of equality is multi-faceted. Advocates for abortion rights often argue that restricting access to abortion disproportionately affects marginalized groups, including low-income individuals and people of color, who may already face significant barriers to healthcare. In this view, ensuring access to safe and legal abortion is a way to support equality by giving all individuals control over their reproductive choices.\n\nIt’s essential to recognize this is a deeply personal and divisive issue, with legitimate concerns and values on both sides.

They may also be concerned about the consequences of forcing someone to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term, which could lead to significant social, economic, and psychological challenges for both the parent and child.\n\nFurthermore, the issue of equality is multi-faceted. Advocates for abortion rights often argue that restricting access to abortion disproportionately affects marginalized groups, including low-income individuals and people of color, who may already face significant barriers to healthcare. In this view, ensuring access to safe and legal abortion is a way to support equality by giving all individuals control over their reproductive choices.\n\nIt’s essential to recognize this is a deeply personal and divisive issue, with legitimate concerns and values on both sides. Engaging in open, respectful dialogue can help us better understand the complexities involved and work towards solutions that consider the needs and rights of all individuals involved.",

Do you believe that autonomy is greater than morality? Personally, I see the most logic in the argument that a fetus is living and has just as much value as you and I. It's heart beats, it grows, and it responds to a mother's touch. \nI believe autonomy is good but sometimes morality impedes on autonomy. An extreme example of this concept would be: A molester has the autonomy to prey on his victims, morally this is an awful wrong and he should be severely punished and morality should trump over his autonomy in this area.\nI only ask that you consider what is more valuable to you- autonomy or morality and let you convictions be founded on truth.",

While as a net country, China and India may be polluting more, their carbon footprint per capita is much smaller than US citizen, as with most other western nations. US citizens has the most personal ability to reduce individuals carbon footprint. While it isn't fair that people in traditional energy industries may lose their jobs, it also isn't fair to the people in the global south to become climate refugees or simply die of climate-related deaths for our convenience. Climate change is coming for all of us, not just liberals or republicans, the bi-partisan split has done so much in dividing us as a nation so the people in power never have to do anything for our sake. Imagine if we don't treat climate change as the coming catastrophe that it is, will anybody, liberal or republican, be able to keep their current quality of life? I understand that this cure is the equivalent of a half-body amputation when your legs are diseased, and that is seemingly not worth it, but the results of not doing this is certain \"death. \"",

Consciousness isn't even gained until one is 2-3 years old. Abortions are an essential human right that should not be taken away.",

This could be that the mother is going to be harmed, which could be debated, but often the baby is too premature to be delivered and wouldn't end up making it. Or if the child has absolutely no hope of making it at all. I can't imagine going through all that just to not even have any results, it's heartbreaking. The child could be a product of assault, a family member, or otherwise. Nobody should have to experience that in the first place, but on top of that, it could get so much worse. I can assure you, nobody is getting an abortion because they're too lazy to grab condoms.",

There are also examples of individuals losing their platforms over a misunderstanding. Clips can now be taken out of context (for example, a streamer who says \"I used to like children romantically...when I was a child\"), accounts get hacked, and AI-created videos and voice clips are getting more convincing. Additionally, there is even research showing that students on campus and public figures feel less comfortable even talking about sensitive topics that might get them \"canceled.\" It may be that most of the people who we call out for bad behavior online or in the world genuinely deserve it, but I haven't seen much discussion about the issue of false-positives or how to create an environment that is friendly to discussion, even when that might be offensive.",

There are also examples of individuals losing their platforms over a misunderstanding. Clips can now be taken out of context (for example, a streamer who says \"I used to like children romantically...when I was a child\"), accounts get hacked, and AI-created videos and voice clips are getting more convincing. Additionally, there is even research showing that students on campus and public figures feel less comfortable even talking about sensitive topics that might get them \"canceled.\" It may be that most of the people who we call out for bad behavior online or in the world genuinely deserve it, but I haven't seen much discussion about the issue of false-positives or how to create an environment that is friendly to discussion, even when that might be offensive.",

I feel like there are some cases where we should prioritize the well-being of the mother if we are unsure if the baby will even survive.",

If our environment is not in good condition, crops will diminish causing food insecurity problems. If our environment is not doing good, it is not possible for our livestock to thrive. If both livestock and crops are struggling to thrive, the compounding consequences will not provide for an environment suitable for human life. To protect the jobs of farmers, factory workers, grocery store workers and everyone in the line of food processing, we have to protect our environment first.",

Many people who participate in call-out culture are motivated by a desire to address real harm and hold people accountable, especially when traditional systems fail to do so.

It’s important to recognize that while the intent behind calling out harmful behavior is often to promote accountability and justice, the approach can sometimes feel extreme or disproportionate. Many people who participate in call-out culture are motivated by a desire to address real harm and hold people accountable, especially when traditional systems fail to do so. However, I agree that it’s crucial to balance this accountability with fairness and empathy, ensuring that responses allow room for growth, learning, and context. Instead of canceling someone outright, fostering conversations that encourage understanding and positive change might help uphold the values of liberty and human rights that both sides care about deeply.",

Often times, abortion is considered as an option not because of financial restriction or disability of the child, but of potential harm threatened to the mother (birth complications, severe risk of PPD, etc). These lives of the mothers need to be considered, as well. Additionally, if abortion is considered due to more trivial manners such as lack of finances or not wanting the responsibility, we need to fix the adoption and foster care systems to make them applicable alternatives that will not have lasting devastating experiences for the children.",

However, by similar reasoning, I think it's unfair to the parent of the child to force them to give birth if doing so will harm their livelihood. In our society, the financial and emotional cost of caring for another human how we should be cared for should not be taken for granted. If giving birth would complicate the life of the parent, and consequently give the child a harder life as well, is that worth it so that the child can have a life? Or to reword that, is it better to live a difficult life or to not live one without knowing of the life that could've been lived?",

I do understand that you do care about this topic, however, there are a lot of factors that come into play with abortion. It's not always about convenience but rather people being able to be in control over their own bodies. You're saying that \"slaughtering unborn living human beings\" doesn't help equality, yet by taking away the option for abortions, it removes the control that people have over their bodies. That is also a matter of civil rights and equality. I do understand and agree that it's not the best thing for people to abort their babies if it has a disability. You also need to see that if it's going to be expensive, some people are too young to be able to financially support themselves and a baby. Or, some people may be at an age they want a baby but they might not be financially there yet. In these cases, it might actually be in the best interest for both the parent and the unborn baby.",

Instead of making up phrases and using words like \"slaughtered\" which is a bit extreme but not unexpected given how this argument started, if you wanted to really look at fairness and equality- change your perspective. I do understand that you do care about this topic, however, there are a lot of factors that come into play with abortion. It's not always about convenience but rather people being able to be in control over their own bodies. You're saying that \"slaughtering unborn living human beings\" doesn't help equality, yet by taking away the option for abortions, it removes the control that people have over their bodies. That is also a matter of civil rights and equality. I do understand and agree that it's not the best thing for people to abort their babies if it has a disability. You also need to see that if it's going to be expensive, some people are too young to be able to financially support themselves and a baby. Or, some people may be at an age they want a baby but they might not be financially there yet. In these cases, it might actually be in the best interest for both the parent and the unborn baby.",

The medical attention needed during your pregnancy and after the birth costs lots of money, especially to those who do not have health insurance. It is not safe or healthy to bring a baby into the world when you know you will not be able to support it, emotionally or financially. You never know how or why someone got pregnant. There are also risks with every pregnancy. Some abortions are needed when the pregnancy puts the mother at risk. Abortion helps equality by providing every women with the same opportunity to have a child or not have a child.",

Reality is most people agree both on the right and left that in cases of incest, harm to the mother it should be allowed. I think the clash on abortion is actually that it's often used for convenience. Allowing would be fathers to not face consequence of what they done, and leaving would be mothers sentencing a human life to death simply because its not sustainable. People often take more risk if there is an option that save them from recklessness; killing innocent lives shouldn't be an option.",

I wish we lived in a world where abortions weren't necessary but we do and until we live in a world where everyone has adequate resources to raise their children, or have accessible birth control methods, or where women are not raped and abused, abortions will always need to be an option.

It’s understandable to be wary of how major changes might affect people, especially those in traditional energy industries.\n\nHowever, it’s important to consider that while China and India do contribute significantly to pollution, the U.S. is also a major contributor to global emissions, and addressing climate change requires a global effort. By taking action here, we can set an example and encourage other countries to do the same, as well as advance technology that can help reduce emissions worldwide.\n\nRegarding scientific consensus, it’s true that there have been predictions about climate change that haven’t fully materialized in the expected timeframe, but the broader scientific agreement remains that the climate is changing, largely due to human activities. Even if some predictions seem off, the evidence of rising temperatures, extreme weather, and other effects is strong.\n\nIn terms of job loss, I completely agree that it’s not fair for working-class people to bear the brunt of these changes. That’s why many propose policies that include job training and support for workers transitioning from traditional energy to renewable energy sectors, which could create new jobs and industries.\n\nIt’s a complex issue, and I appreciate you bringing up these important concerns.

    "message_text": "Thank you for sharing your perspective. I hear your concerns about the economic impact of environmental policies and skepticism about the extent of climate change. It’s understandable to be wary of how major changes might affect people, especially those in traditional energy industries.\n\nHowever, it’s important to consider that while China and India do contribute significantly to pollution, the U.S. is also a major contributor to global emissions, and addressing climate change requires a global effort. By taking action here, we can set an example and encourage other countries to do the same, as well as advance technology that can help reduce emissions worldwide.\n\nRegarding scientific consensus, it’s true that there have been predictions about climate change that haven’t fully materialized in the expected timeframe, but the broader scientific agreement remains that the climate is changing, largely due to human activities. Even if some predictions seem off, the evidence of rising temperatures, extreme weather, and other effects is strong.\n\nIn terms of job loss, I completely agree that it’s not fair for working-class people to bear the brunt of these changes. That’s why many propose policies that include job training and support for workers transitioning from traditional energy to renewable energy sectors, which could create new jobs and industries.\n\nIt’s a complex issue, and I appreciate you bringing up these important concerns. It’s vital that any solution balances environmental responsibility with economic fairness for everyone involved.",

When it becomes a lecture and not a conversation, I am disengaged. \nAll this being said, I acknowledge that my view on 'cancel culture', as it stands now, is largely based only on these encounters I have had, and that I have much to learn and understand through more exposure and conversations.",

When it comes to energy, I do think renewable sources are the future, but I think the rate at which they are being pushed is too fast for how efficient they are at the moment.",

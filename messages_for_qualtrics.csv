Furthermore, the issue of equality is multi-faceted.

I understand, and I share your concern for working class people in America and around the world. I have experience in environmental health research, and based on what I have studied I think that working class Americans are not just at risk of being affected by environmental issues later, but are deeply affected by environmental issues right now. Based on what I've read, health issues ranging from mental health issues to infertility to Alzheimer's to cancer have been linked to more frequent natural disasters, air pollution, water pollution, and warmer temperatures, and these health impacts are the greatest for the working class. I also believe that climate change is not an all or nothing proposition. While it may be true that other countries are polluting more than the United States, I do not think that means that taking action in the U.S. will not make a difference. From what I understand, reducing global warming by fractions of a degree could still mean significantly less devastating natural disasters like wildfires and hurricanes in the future.

Based on what I've read, health issues ranging from mental health issues to infertility to Alzheimer's to cancer have been linked to more frequent natural disasters, air pollution, water pollution, and warmer temperatures, and these health impacts are the greatest for the working class.

Yes, abortions can occur for financial reasons or if their is a risk of health complications (of the child) or disbility. Other reasons include health complications of the women giving birth and the potential birth of a child born from rape. If going through pregnancy presents potentially fatal health risks, a women should have a choice of abortion. If a women becomes pregnant through rape, she should not be forced to have the child. Furthermore, the government determining if a women can have an abortion seems like a set too far in regards to legislature.

It's clear that you're concerned about the potential economic impact, particularly on working-class communities in traditional energy sectors, and the effectiveness of environmental policies. These are important considerations, especially when jobs and livelihoods are at stake.

However, I’d like to offer a different view on some of the points you raised. While it’s true that countries like China and India are major polluters, the U.S. also has a significant impact on global emissions, and what we do can set a powerful example for the rest of the world. The argument that our actions won’t make a difference overlooks the potential for technological innovation and leadership that can drive global change. Moreover, addressing environmental issues isn't just about immediate effects but about ensuring a sustainable future for all, including the communities currently dependent on fossil fuels.

Regarding the scientific consensus, it’s important to note that climate predictions are complex and involve a range of scenarios. While some early predictions may not have played out exactly as expected, the overwhelming evidence still points to significant changes in our climate, with rising sea levels and more extreme weather patterns already affecting many areas. The focus should be on mitigating these risks before they become unmanageable.

Lastly, the transition to greener energy doesn’t have to be at the expense of working-class jobs.

As I grew up, I saw the changes in how heat waves killed many people, acid rains killed cattle, floods got worse, making people homeless, and food prices went higher due to limited land left for agriculture. Things were not like this before; natural calamities are happening much more frequently because of climate change. Those countries are doing more than the USA to check climate change by banning plastic use, using reusable materials, planting more trees, and using public and electric transport. The USA faces climate change impact to a lesser extent because its location is close to the North Pole, so the weather is not hotter in the summer months like other places on earth. 
Traditional energy jobs negatively impact the employees' health and the whole community where the raw materials are collected, as they leak into surrounding ground and water.

Remember, it takes a man and a women to have a baby, but women are left with the consequences. Many of these women simply do not have the resources to raise a child. Without the proper foster care systems or alternative solutions in place, I do not think it is selfish to give a child a life in which that child is unwanted and not provided for. Women are also at a heavy disadvantage in the workplace when they have families. My mother's career as a lawyer was always seen as less important to my father because she was raising my sisters and I. However, she was doing twice the amount of work as he was. From my perspective, controlling women's bodies is just another way to control women - to keep them out of jobs and positions of power.",159,4.5,0,1,"pro_harris","Abortion",4,"msg_545",1090

22307535709,"treatment","Thank you for sharing your perspective. I hear your concerns about the economic impact of environmental policies and skepticism about the extent of climate change. It’s understandable to be wary of how major changes might affect people, especially those in traditional energy industries.

However, it’s important to consider that while China and India do contribute significantly to pollution, the U.S. is also a major contributor to global emissions, and addressing climate change requires a global effort. By taking action here, we can set an example and encourage other countries to do the same, as well as advance technology that can help reduce emissions worldwide.

Regarding scientific consensus, it’s true that there have been predictions about climate change that haven’t fully materialized in the expected timeframe, but the broader scientific agreement remains that the climate is changing, largely due to human activities. Even if some predictions seem off, the evidence of rising temperatures, extreme weather, and other effects is strong.

In terms of job loss, I completely agree that it’s not fair for working-class people to bear the brunt of these changes. That’s why many propose policies that include job training and support for workers transitioning from traditional energy to renewable energy sectors, which could create new jobs and industries.

You feel that everyone, even those who may have made mistakes, deserves a chance to learn and grow without having their entire livelihood destroyed. I also hear your frustration with what you see as a contradiction in the values of some who participate in cancel culture.

From my perspective, the idea behind calling out problematic behavior is often to hold individuals accountable, especially when other systems of justice might fall short. However, I agree that it’s important for these conversations to be thoughtful and for people to have the opportunity to explain themselves or show change. Maybe there’s a way to find balance—where people can still be held responsible for their actions, but also given the chance to reflect, grow, and make amends.
